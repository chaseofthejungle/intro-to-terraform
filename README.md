# Intro to Terraform
  
**Definition/Overview:** HashiCorp's *Terraform* is a popular example of an Infrastructure-as-Code, or ‘IaC’, software solution that serves popular cloud infrastructure providers (such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, and many more). It is utilized to streamline and otherwise simplify infrastructure provisions and deployments, providing optimal management and scalability services. Terraform defines data center infrastructure through the use of JSON or HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), making flexible and reusable declarative configurations plausible.
